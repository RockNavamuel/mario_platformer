**Project Description**

In this project, I created a Mario platformer game. Enjoy!

**Objective:** 

The goal is to last long enough to collect 10 "Stars" while avoiding falling objects and enemies.

**Instructions:** 

Use WASD keys for all movement. Hold "W" to quickly jump through platforms, but watch out for falling objects!

**Demo:**
